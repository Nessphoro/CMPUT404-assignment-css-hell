                My name is Pavlo Malynin and I am currently a 5th year Computing Science student at the University of
                Alberta
                in the beautiful city of Edmonton.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far my focus has been primarily in Machine Learning and Embedded Systems, but more recently I have
                been branching
                out into different areas of Computer Science like Web Development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Professionally, I have 3 years of development experience at large companies in a variety of languages.
                However, I've been coding since the age of 12 and through that gained a very broad immersion into the
                world of programming
                making things ranging from games to hobby operating systems and distributed Docker engines.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not currently looking for offers, having accepted a full-time offer from Apple for a Security
                Software Engineer position.
                But if you are a recruiter in the Bay Area, I would be interested in gettig in touch for some future
                opportunities.
